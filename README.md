## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The two variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of vairance to the mpg values in the dataset include vehicle_length and ground clearance. These indicated a p-value greater than <.05. Vehicl weight may be consdiered, but the value isn't significant enough to mention.
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? No the slope of the linear model isn't '0' because the values of the y intercept are greater than '0'. 
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
It provides a baseline but may not tell the whole story. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has studies indicate that the fuel consumption profile is based on other factors like payload, and so consumers may not be getting the full picture. 

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
